All your midwifery appointments will happen at your home, at a time that suits you and your family (weekdays, weekends, daytime, evenings), our appointments are unhurried (because we don’t have 20 other women to see in an antenatal clinic) – so we can spend as little or as long with you as you need – compared to the standard 20 minute NHS appointment times. We really get to know you because we spend so much time together! This is so useful because we know what you want for your birth, what makes you tick and we learn how best we can support you as the individual you are. We guarantee you access to home birth – home birth services in Kent are limited due to general maternity staff shortages, but we can guarantee you access to home birth and that there’ll be two midwives present at your birth. We are available via WhatsApp throughout your pregnancy and into the postnatal period for any of those little questions you need answering on the spot. We are on-call 24/7 from when you are 37 weeks pregnant – ready to head to your home when you call us in labour. We have over 20 years combined experience working in busy London teaching hospitals and on ‘low risk’ birth centres and this experience has made us extremely skilled midwives. Having the same midwife throughout your pregnancy and birth journey is also proven by research to improve outcomes.
